        <h2>About me</h2>

          <p>Hi, I'm Ross Pottinger. I was born in Edinburgh and moved to Perth when I was 13. I have two sisters — one older and one younger — and we've had several family dogs over the years, all cocker spaniels. Outside of my studies, I enjoy a range of hobbies and spending time with friends and family.</p>

        <h2>Psychology</h2>

          <p>I'm currently studying Psychology at university, having started in 2023. I’ve always been fascinated by how people think and interact with the world around them. Understanding the brain's mechanisms and how they shape individual experiences and behaviours is something I find deeply interesting.</p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>

          <p>I first got into coding in 2022, when I took a month-long web development course with CodeClan, followed by a short internship. Since then, I’ve kept up the interest through university, taking elective modules in the subject. I’ve learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little Python and C++. One of my most challenging (and rewarding) projects was during my internship, where I helped build a prototype app that let football fans pre-order food from their seats.</p>
