        <h1>Scuba Diving</h1>
          
        <h2>First experiences</h2>
          <p>I first tried scuba diving nearly a decade ago while on holiday in Greece. My dad had always been a keen diver, and I’d been eager to try it for myself. My first experience was a try dive in a swimming pool, followed by an open water dive where we swam past ancient Greek amphoras buried in the sand. The sensation of breathing and moving weightlessly underwater was incredible — it felt like entering an entirely new world. That first taste left me wanting more: to explore further, dive deeper, and develop the skills needed to go on underwater adventures of my own.</p>

        <h2>1st year</h2>
          <p>When I started university in 2023, one of the first things I did was join the scuba diving society — coincidentally, the very same one my dad had joined over 40 years earlier. I began training for my BSAC Ocean Diver qualification, attending weekly pool sessions to build up my diving skills. I completed the course with a cold but unforgettable December trip to Oban, where I undertook my open water dives and officially qualified as an Ocean Diver. <br> The most memorable dives from my first year were those in Oban and Loch Duich. I encountered all kinds of marine wildlife and became much more confident and comfortable in the water.</p>

        <h2>2nd year</h2>
          <p>In my second year, I continued to be involved in both scuba diving and the university society. I took on the role of treasurer, managing the club's finances and helping support its ongoing activities. Although I haven’t had many chances to dive this year, I’m looking forward to getting back in the water soon. My next goal is to earn the BSAC Sports Diver qualification and keep building my diving experience.</p>
